Introduction
------------
Python-ideal is an iDeal implementation written in Python.

We werent able to find an iDeal client implementation for Python, besides
PayDeal which appears to be a literal translation of the PHP reference
client. This client aims to be a bit more Pythonic.

See your iDeal implementation docs for more info about iDeal and the
way it works.

Dependencies
------------
* lxml
* m2crypto
* xmlsec (non-python, http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/)

The module has been run using python 2.6.5 and 2.5.2 deployments, but other
versions might work as well.

Example
-------
Example usage (taken from a Django project).

acquirer = Acquirer(endpoint=settings.IDEAL_ACQUIRER_ENDPOINT,
                    cert=Cert(settings.IDEAL_ACQUIRER_CERT))

merchant = Merchant(merchant_id=settings.IDEAL_MERCHANT_ID,
                    sub_id=settings.IDEAL_MERCHANT_SUBID,
                    cert=Cert(settings.IDEAL_MERCHANT_CERT),
                    pem=Pem(settings.IDEAL_MERCHANT_PEM, settings.IDEAL_MERCHANT_PEM_PASSWORD))

connector = IDEALConnector(merchant=merchant, acquirer=acquirer)

# Can now use
connector.get_issuer_list()
connector.request_transaction(self, issuer_id, purchase_id, amount,
                              description, entrance_code,
                              return_url)
connector.request_transaction_status(self, transaction_id)

Problem?
--------
You will probably have issues on Ubuntu with M2Crypto, specifically the error:

    _m2crypto.so: undefined symbol: SSLv2_method

Use this script to install M2Crypto in your virtualenv and all will be fine
https://github.com/Motiejus/django-webtopay/blob/master/m2crypto_ubuntu

Additionally, on Ubuntu 13.10+ when building m2crypto it may be unable to
find openssl/opensslconf.h. This can be fixed by adding the path to it to your
~/.pydistutils.cfg as shown below. Note that the path may vary based on your
architecture.

cat ~/.pydistutils.cfg
[global]
include_dirs = /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/

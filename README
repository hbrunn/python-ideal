Introduction

Python-ideal is an iDeal implementation written in Python.

We werent able to find an iDeal client implementation for Python, besides
PayDeal which appears to be a literal translation of the PHP reference
client. This client aims to be a bit more Pythonic.

Dependencies
------------
* lxml
* m2crypto

Python 2.6.5 was used during development, but other versions might work as well.
